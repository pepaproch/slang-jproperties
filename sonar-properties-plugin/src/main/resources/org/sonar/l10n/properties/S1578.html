    Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule checks that all file names match a
    provided regular expression.

    As Java properties files are used in a large variety of ways and by many frameworks, it might sometimes be tricky to
    enforce a
    strict file naming convention. However, the default regular expression has been designed to match as closely as
    possible the
    following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Suffix files with <code>.properties</code></li>
    <li>Only use letters, digits, '_' and '-' characters</li>
    <li>Refrain from using '_' and '-' characters. Only use them when mandatory such as in i18n Java resource bundles.
    </li>
    <li>Extensively use Camel Case. For example, prefer:
        <pre>
myProperties.properties
</pre>
        to
        <pre>
myproperties.properties
my_properties.properties
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
