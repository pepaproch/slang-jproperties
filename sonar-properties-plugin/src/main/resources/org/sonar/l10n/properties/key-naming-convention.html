    Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all keys match a provided
    regular expression.

    As Java properties files are used in a large variety of ways and by many frameworks, it might sometimes be tricky to
    enforce a strict key naming convention. However, the default regular expression has been designed to match as
    closely as possible the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only use letters, digits and '.' characters
        <pre>
bank-account-number=123456   # Noncompliant
bank_account_owner=John Doe  # Noncompliant
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Follow object-oriented programming concept as much as possible. For example, prefer:
        <pre>
bank.account.number=123456
bank.account.owner=John Doe
</pre>
        to
        <pre>
bankAccountNumber=123456
bankAccountOwner=John Doe
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Whenever possible, use lowercase characters. For example, prefer:
        <pre>
bank.account.number=123456
bank.account.owner=John Doe
</pre>
        to
        <pre>
Bank.Account.Number=123456
Bank.Account.Owner=John Doe
</pre>
        But keep it readable. For example, prefer:
        <pre>
font.timesNewRoman.size=10
</pre>
        to
        <pre>
font.timesnewroman.size=10
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
