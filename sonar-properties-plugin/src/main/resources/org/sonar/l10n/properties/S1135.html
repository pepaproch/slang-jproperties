  <code>TODO</code> tags are commonly used to mark places where some more code is required, but which the developer
  wants to implement later. Sometimes the developer will not have the time or will simply forget to get back to that
  tag. This rule is meant to track those tags, and ensure that they do not go unnoticed.
